###Firebase Integration<br>
The live version of the contact manager at  https://ourcontacts-6b243.web.app/#/  is hosted on Firebase and uses Firebase Realtime Database to store the contacts. Firebase is a powerful platform for building web and mobile applications, and it provides a wide range of features, including hosting, databases, authentication, and more.
<br>
To integrate Firebase into your own project, you will need to create a Firebase account and follow the instructions for setting up Firebase in your project. Once Firebase is set up, you can use the Firebase SDKs to access Firebase services in your JavaScript code.
